Simple Calculator Program

This file describes the C++ program for a basic calculator that performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division based on user input.

Code Structure

1. Header Files and Namespace

    - Header Files: The #include <iostream> directive includes the standard input-output stream library for reading user input and printing output.
    - Namespace: using namespace std; allows the use of standard library functions and objects without needing to prefix them with std::.

2. MAIN FUNCTION

    - Variable Declarations:
        - char op; - Variable to store the arithmetic operator entered by the user.
        - float num1, num2; - Variables to store the two numbers provided by the user.

    - User Input:
        - The program prompts the user to enter an arithmetic operator and two numbers.
        - cin >> op; - Reads the arithmetic operator from user input.
        - cin >> num1 >> num2; - Reads the two numbers from user input.

    - Switch Statement:
        - The switch statement is used to perform the arithmetic operation based on the operator entered.
        - Case '+': Performs addition and prints the result.
        - Case '-': Performs subtraction and prints the result.
        - Case '*': Performs multiplication and prints the result.
        - Case '/': Performs division and prints the result. If the divisor (num2) is zero, it prints an error message to prevent division by zero.
        - Default Case: Handles unsupported operators by printing an error message.

    - Error Handling: The program prints an error message for unsupported operations and division by zero scenarios.

3. Returning from Main Function

    return 0;

    - Return Statement: Indicates that the program has executed successfully. Returning 0 is a common convention to signify successful completion.

Example Usage

Enter an arithmetic operator (+ - * /):
+
Enter two numbers as operands:
5 3
5 + 3 = 8

Known Issues

- Division by Zero: The program handles division by zero by printing an error message.
